South China Normal University is an institution of higher education with a long history and a rich legacy. Situated in Guangzhou, the open metropolis in South China, South China Normal University is imbued with Lingnan's pioneering and pragmatic spirits. It has developed a tradition of elegant simplicity and fostered a strong learning environment. In the past seventy years or so, South China Normal University has preserved its characteristics of teacher education and has been devoted to cultivating talents with moral integrity, independent thinking, innovative ability and sense of social responsibility.

In the new century in which the institutions of higher education are getting increasingly involved in the social and economic development, South China Normal University has adopted an international view on education. Having broadened its horizon on the key issue of cultivating talents, it has made its greatest efforts to create a congenial and harmonious environment for both teaching and academic research and has fostered a rich variety of campus culture. It aims to build itself into a high-level comprehensive teaching and research-oriented university with open distinctive features.
